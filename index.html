            <h2>My Love ❤️</h2>
            <p>
               <p>For me you are my beautiful lover, beautiful friend and a strong & understanding support system.
You are the one with the prettiest soul and prettiest heart and prettiest face.</p>
<p>You are not just my future wife but you are that cute bacha of mine who is never replacable. I always wanted to be a special person for someone and u did this for me. I crave your attention and love and if its a little bit less than that little is enough to make me cry.
My Love, words are not enough to describe you for sure.</p> <p>Whenever I look at you I begin to think koi itna pyara kesy ho sakta hy. I dont know if you realise it or not but you have that rare softness in your heart that makes everyone around you feel comfortable & understood. Some people are good by words but you are really good by heart.</p> <p><h3>Meri Jaan For me you are Ineffable.</h3></p> <p>I swear these words cant describe what you are and what place you have in my heart. But still I have some prayers for you.</p>
            <p>1. “I wish you more days when you fall asleep with a smile.”</p>
            <p>2. “May your dreams come true faster than you have time to make them.”</p>
            <p>3. “I wish you to meet people who understand you with just half a word.”</p>
            <p>4. “May you always have the courage to do what you plan.”</p>
            <p>5. “I wish you moments that take your breath away.”</p>
            <p>6. “May your intuition never let you down.”</p>
            <p>7. “I wish you to fall in love with life again every single day.”</p>
            <p>8. “May you always have enough energy for what truly matters.”</p>
            <p>9. “I wish you to surround yourself only with people who truly deserve you.”</p>
            <p>10. “May each new year of your life be better than the last — not in numbers, but in how it feels.”</p>
            </p>
